## Problem Details
Title: "274. H-Index"
Difficulty: "Medium"
Primary Topic: "Array"
tags: ["Array", "Sorting", "Counting Sort"]

## Intuition

To find the `h` index (The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.).
Sorting the input helps us in keeping track of amount of papers then it just simple comparison of the max value and the max value between max, papers and current citation value.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] c) {
        Arrays.sort(c);
        
        int n = c.length;
        int max = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int papers = n - i;
            if (papers > c[i]) {
                max = Math.max(max, c[i]);
            } else {
                max = Math.max(max, papers);
            }
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
